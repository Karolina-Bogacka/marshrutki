Things to do for the project:
- I'll be using osBrain and sumo, so that's settled
- Our project should visualize a system of "marshrutka" agents, clients and holonic schedulers
- that means three types of succesful agents and a few methods for each, for sure
- these should be in my old presentation
- I should write an email about it tomorrow or today, to ask about it maybe, in theory. But should I?
On the one hand using sumo-gui means using gui, means maybe slowing it down; on the other hand, maybe
  I can just use sumo with no gui?
  - should I get a database? I would wait with that, I think
    
- For the simple version of that, I should probably also have a script that would visualize n people and n cars 
with random targets, first in the one neighborhood, then outside of it later.
